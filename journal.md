We sat down and discussed to finalize the general direction we wanted to go in. We decided that we did not want to focus on anything too complex otherwise we could lose sight of the project and what we wanted to focus on. To this, we were interested in focusing on disease prediction.

Discussed multiple papers we looked at over the past days and decided to focus on a really solid grape dataset which also includes environmental variables. With regards to ML technique, we want to look at supervised techniques such as random forests, and LSTM networks to capture both spatial-temporal patterns and non-linear interactions in the data.
